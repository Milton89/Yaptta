	<p>
	  In this project the goal is to use the Android Phones as
Walkie-Talkies (push to talk) devices. The idea is to have a group of
users specified in some way that can talk to each other as follows:
when one user activates its microphone (e.g., by pressing a button on
his/her phone), the voice from that user is digitized, packetized and
the packets from that user are forwarded to all the other users (as
VoIP packets), where they are played on their phones. While one user
talks, all other microphones are disabled, for conflict resolution,
you can use an ID number or such.

	<p>The groups can be specified in a number of ways, any of them are OK:
	  <ul>
	    <li>The users can specify a <q>channel</q> (eventually with a password) and thus is joins the group.
<li> The users can explicitly select the recipients of their packets
  (from a list).
  <li> The groups are pre-established and the user can join any one
  group (or multiple groups). Not all users in a pre-established group
  may be present at any one time.
</ul>

<p>You can assume that the users are on the same IP network (so you can
  discover other users via broadcast), or, better yet, you can use a
  centralized server for service discovery (where you connect to see
  who's available).

<p>This should work at least over WiFi, although it would be nice if
  the VoIP packets would be parsimonious enough to fit through the
  EDGE network (although the delay may be a problem).


<p>A team attempted the project in
<a href="../../OldProjects/Fall2009/WalkieTalkie/index.html">Fall
2009</a>. They did a half-decent job, but used the wrong APIs for
transfering the data, and thus it worked pretty poorly.


<p>To successfully complete this project you need to have:
<ul>
<li> Good knowledge of Java;
</ul>

<h3> Deliverables </h3>

<ul>
<li> Demonstration 
<li> Well commented code 
<li> Report
</ul>
